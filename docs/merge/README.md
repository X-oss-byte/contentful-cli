# Contentful CLI - Merge command

This subcommand brings in some of the functionality from the [Merge App](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/app/merge/) into the CLI.
It allows developers to programatically view and export the diff between content types similarly to how the Merge App does it.

One of the functionalities not yet here is merging as you can do it with [contentful-migration](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-migration/blob/master/README.md#reference-documentation)

## Available sub-commands:

- [show](./show) - Show diff in content types between two environments.
- [export](./export) - Export diff between in content types two environments as a migration.
